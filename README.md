# COL774 Assignments

This repository contains my assignment submissions for COL774 (Machine Learning).

1. Assignment 1: Linear regression, stochastic gradient descent, logistic regression, Gaussian discriminant analysis

2. Assignment 2: Naive Bayes, binary and multi-class support vector machines using a quadratic programming solver and stochastic gradient descent alongside extensive hyperparameter tuning

3. Assignment 3: Decision tree with post-pruning, random forest classifiers with hyperparameter tuning and parameter sensitivity analysis, generic fully-connected neural networks with sigmoid and relu
   activation functions.
