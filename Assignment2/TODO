read on k-fold cross validation and so on
feature engineering in q1 - done (bigram + log frequency)
roc
actually fill in output files - done for Q1, remaining - Q2, Q3
in q1, instead of enabling or disabling certain features by commenting out, actually write if statements and pass parameters
check what we really need to output
instead of storing the whole data, store support vectors - done
actually just store alpha_sv, index_sv, b -> index_sv gives x_sv and y_sv by reading off the indices after concatenating x_train[i] and x_train[j]
last part of cross validation
redo Q1 - done
